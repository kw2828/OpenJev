## Chess

[![Our locally trained candidate policy playing the first scheduled game, a draw](docs/assets/chess-candidate-game-001.gif)](https://kw2828.github.io/OpenJev/chess-candidate-replay.html)

Our candidate experiment compares **four small chess policies across twelve fits and 288 games**. Each scores every legal move. Two variants use exact next-board states from native chess rules. The GIF shows the first scheduled game, drawn by repetition.

![All twelve candidate-policy fits, move quality, games and computation cost](docs/assets/chess-candidate-results.png)

Exact-delta matched Stockfish on **33.15%** of ordinary positions versus **31.75%** for direct scoring, and **27.10% versus 26.81%** on shifted positions. It costs more compute and **fails the engine-loss and game-score continuation criteria**. These development results establish neither a learned world model nor an Elo rating.

On a separate **4,096-position ChessBench transfer panel**, the four model families average **26.03-26.79%** move agreement. The gains remain small. [Transfer results](docs/chessbench-transfer.md).

The completed [connectome study](docs/chess-connectome.md) compared biological wiring with three rewired controls, dense recurrence and node-local recurrence across three seeds. It **did not establish a biological-wiring advantage**: only **5 of 30** required checks passed. All 21 models are shown below; there is no gameplay or Elo result for this study.

The [30-fit mapping follow-up](research/chess-connectome-mapping-study.md) reduced biological-model loss by 8.6% on ordinary positions, with no improvement under shift. It also failed its continuation rule.

The latest [24-fit graph comparison](docs/chess-pin-quality.md) found **36.43% / 31.40%** ordinary/shifted move agreement for joint pin factors, below the WLDN baseline's **37.16% / 31.92%**, while taking **13.1% more decision time**. Only 2/16 quality checks passed. The proposed mechanism did not earn continuation.

## Doom

[![Locally trained Doom policy](docs/assets/jepa-policy-181000-preview.gif)](docs/assets/jepa-policy-181000.gif)

**13 kills in 19.26 game seconds**, first fit and first evaluation seed. JEPA scored training clips; a small policy plays the recording. [Results and limits](docs/jepa-rl-study.md) · [Recording receipt](docs/assets/jepa-policy-181000.json).

## Robot reaching

[![First robot case: persistent memory and three trained reset controls](evidence/reacher-geometry-memory-v1/report/fixed-case-replay.gif)](research/reacher-geometry-memory.md)

**The stronger memory comparison failed its continuation rule: 24/25 checks.** Persistent GRU lowered control cost by **4.44%/2.94%** versus a separately trained model using two observations and intervening actions. The rule required at least 3% on both sensing-gap panels. All three paired fits improved, but the ten-step mean missed the required margin.

![All nine models and five references in the completed two-observation comparison](evidence/reacher-two-observation-study-v1/report/native-costs.png)

Supplied-physics controllers still perform better. Equal search budgets do not match total compute. The GIF replays the preselected first case from the earlier study; the chart shows all 42 rows of the new comparison. [New results and audit](research/reacher-two-observation-control.md).

The [earlier comparison](research/reacher-geometry-memory.md) passed all 25 checks against the weaker one-observation control, with 31.9%/26.0% lower cost. Neither study establishes a new architecture or biological-wiring advantage. [Earlier paper](output/pdf/openjev-reacher-geometry-memory-study.pdf) · [LaTeX](paper/reacher-geometry-memory-study.tex).

## Research results

- [Shared-token dialogue experiment](research/dialogue-token-results.md): training stopped at **7/12 fits**. [Projecting before scattering](research/dialogue-token-projection-results.md) gives **1.28-1.45x speedups** across four variants on one real mask layout with artificial values, but still fails overall (**10/16 timing checks**). All output/gradient checks pass; no new accuracy result or training restart.
- [Candidate-conditioned encoding cost screen](research/dialogue-joint-capacity-results.md): the 512-text probe completed, but **20.91 minutes projected** exceeded the fixed 12-minute threshold. Full encoding and training did not run. The next proposal reuses dialogue token features across candidates.
- [Corrected candidate text memory](research/dialogue-copy-v2-results.md): **15 fresh fits** pass internal probability checks, but selective memory still fails its rule (**7/13**). Unseen-service macro accuracy is **72.89%**, versus **72.58%** for simpler scalar memory and **65.76%** for literal copying. The correction establishes numerical validity, not an architecture advantage.
- [Earlier recurrent text memory](research/dialogue-memory-results.md): 21 fits; the proposed memory lost to literal copying on unseen services.
- [Text inference](research/shared-prefix-results.md): shared-context prototype, **2.08x faster** for four-question workloads. Synthetic speed benchmark; single-question caching is slower.
- [Biological wiring](docs/chess-connectome.md): the controlled chess study **did not establish a connectome advantage**.
- [Recurrent robot memory](research/reacher-two-observation-control.md): small improvements over two-observation history, but the stronger continuation rule failed.
- [Robot dynamics screen](research/drive-qualification-results.md): 252 episodes; classical calibration leaves too little benefit from exact parameters to justify neural training here.
- [All experiments and visualizations](research/experiment-index.md): complete results, including negative findings, training receipts and paper sources.
