# OpenJev

**Context → questions and candidate answers → probabilities → your application's next step.**

Score choices with stable IDs. Try text decisions in your browser, run local Doom policies, or train a small chess model.

## Chess

[![Our locally trained candidate policy playing the first scheduled game, a draw](docs/assets/chess-candidate-game-001.gif)](https://kw2828.github.io/OpenJev/chess-candidate-replay.html)

Our latest experiment compares **four small chess policies across twelve fits and 288 games**. Each scores every legal move. Two variants use exact next-board states from native chess rules. The GIF shows the first scheduled game, drawn by repetition.

![All twelve candidate-policy fits, move quality, games and computation cost](docs/assets/chess-candidate-results.png)

Exact-delta matched Stockfish on **33.15%** of ordinary positions versus **31.75%** for direct scoring, and **27.10% versus 26.81%** on shifted positions. It costs more compute and **fails the engine-loss and game-score continuation criteria**. These development results establish neither a learned world model nor an Elo rating.

On a separate **4,096-position ChessBench transfer panel**, the four model families average **26.03-26.79%** move agreement. The gains remain small. [Transfer results](docs/chessbench-transfer.md).

The [connectome study](research/chess-connectome-study.md) now has a frozen protocol: biological wiring versus three rewired controls, dense recurrence and node-local recurrence, across three seeds. Results are pending.

## Doom

[![Locally trained Doom policy](docs/assets/jepa-policy-181000-preview.gif)](docs/assets/jepa-policy-181000.gif)

**13 kills in 19.26 game seconds**, first fit and first evaluation seed. JEPA scored training clips; a small policy plays the recording. [Results and limits](docs/jepa-rl-study.md) · [Recording receipt](docs/assets/jepa-policy-181000.json).

## Run locally

Apple Silicon macOS, Python 3.11-3.13:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kw2828/OpenJev.git
cd OpenJev
uv sync --frozen --extra language
uv run --extra language openjev setup
uv run --extra language openjev serve
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8000**. Local text scoring uses Qwen3-4B; the free browser demo uses Qwen3-0.6B through WebGPU. [Linux, Docker and hosting](docs/hosting.md).

## More experiments

- [Astra-trained text students](docs/codex-astra-distillation.md): routing improved; BoolQ remained near chance.
- [Recurrent world models](docs/recurrent-world-model-study.md) and [associative-memory PPO](docs/associative-ppo-study.md): no established memory advantage. [Initialization follow-up](docs/zero-critic-ppo-study.md).
- [Doom PPO/DQN](docs/rl-study.md), [JEPA + RL](docs/jepa-rl-study.md), [all figures](docs/benchmarks.md) and [paper sources](paper/README.md).

Candidate scores are uncalibrated and relative to the supplied choices. These experiments use different models and protocols. MIT for project code and original weights; third-party licenses apply separately.
